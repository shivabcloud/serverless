# serverless

This cloud function, known as PubSubFunction, is a lightweight, serverless computing solution for real-time data analysis. 
It is hosted on Google Cloud Platform and is automatically triggered in response to the pub/sub API. The function processes the data using predefined algorithms, stores the results in a cloud database, and sends an email to the user. PubSubFunction is scalable, ensuring high performance under varying data loads, and only uses resources when active, making it a cost-effective solution for on-demand data processing tasks.
